This was my final project for my Data Mining class here at Quinnipiac. 

I worked individually on this project, and I was tasked with finding a dataset to clean, mine, and analyze. 
The grading rubirc and instructions were loose, however, we needed to include some of the methods we used in class like K-fold Cross-validation, logistic or linear regression, clustering algorithms, and more. 

**Project Proposal**
This document is just what I had to submit prior to beginning my project, and it just shows how I thought about the dataset I was picking, and I know there is two, so I will tell you now that I ended up using the Heart Disease dataset.
