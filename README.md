This was my final project for my Data Mining class here at Quinnipiac. 

I worked individually on this project, and I was tasked with finding a dataset to clean, mine, and analyze. 
The grading rubirc and instructions were loose, however, we needed to include some of the methods we used in class like K-fold Cross-validation, logistic or linear regression, clustering algorithms, and more. 

**Project Proposal**

This document is just what I had to submit prior to beginning my project, and it just shows how I thought about the dataset I was picking, and I know there is two, so I will tell you now that I ended up using the Heart Disease dataset. 

**Final Project Jupyter Notebook**

This is the code I wrote to do all of the methods needed for the project, and I included markdown cells that follow my flow of thoughts and why and how I did things. 


**Final Project Work Document**

This is part of my submission for the project, which is formatted as a research paper, and goes into more depth about why I used the methods I did, and this is also were I made conclusions about the data and the findings. 

**Heart Disease Dataset**

I included this dataset that I found on Kaggle, so feel free to follow along with any of the code if you are so inclined.
